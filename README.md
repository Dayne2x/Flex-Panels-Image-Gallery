This is one of the projects I built during the WesBos JS 30 Day Course. The selection of images represent a selection of art styles I admire. Clicking on the
images will make them expand giving you some information about the characters.

## My process

### Built with:

![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white) <br>
![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) <br>
![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white) <br>
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)


### What I learned

I used JS to create a basic toggle function in order to make the images expand and additional text appear on click. 


### Continued development

For this project I would like to implement a function that makes the initial title text disappear when any of the images are clicked.
